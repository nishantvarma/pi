## Overview

A simple programmable interface for advanced users, particularly those who prefer organizing files and folders as an outliner.

## Big Ideas

* Shell is powerful because it gives a language with *commands* as primitives.
* It can do *anything* expressible in the language.
* O(1) access with auto-completition is good while typing.
* GUI is just partial + auto-complete ahead of time.
